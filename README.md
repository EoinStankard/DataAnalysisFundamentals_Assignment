# DataAnalysisFundamentals_Assignment

### About the Assignment

This assignmenr concerns the well-known tips dataset and the Python packages
seaborn and jupyter.
The assignment contains a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and
plots to describe the tips dataset.
There will be a section that discusses the relationship between the total bill and the tip amount. There will also be plots and calculations between other variables in the dataset.

### About the Tips Dataset

Food servers’ tips in restaurants may be influenced by many factors, including the nature of the restaurant, size of the party, and table locations in the restaurant. Restaurant managers need to know which factors matter when they assign tables to food servers. For the sake of staff morale, they usually want to avoid either the substance or the appearance of unfair treatment of the servers, for whom tips (at least in restaurants in the United States) are a major component of pay. In one restaurant, a food server recorded the following data on all cus- tomers they served during an interval of two and a half months in early 1990. The restaurant, located in a suburban shopping mall, was part of a national chain and served a varied menu. In observance of local law, the restaurant offered to seat in a non-smoking section to patrons who requested it. Each record includes a day and time, and taken together, they show the server’s work schedule.

The Tips dataset contains the following parameters
1. total bill
2. tip
3. sex
4. smoker
5. day
6. day
7. time
8. size

I will be analysing to see if there is a relationship between the different variables of the dataset.

### How to view the Assignment

The assignment can be viewed the following ways

1. Downloading the Repo and running jupyter notebook in the command line. (Recommended)
2. Clicking on the "TipsDataset_Assignment.ipynb" file above,

I recommend that you download and run the assignment on your own machine as some headings are missing when directly clicking on the "TipsDataset_Assignment.ipynb" file above

### What is needed to run the Assignment

1. Anaconda Python as it contains all libraries
2. The Repo will need to be cloned or downloaded

### Short Description of the Assignment sections in the jupyter notebook
The main variables i want to analyse are

##### 1. The relationship between the total bill and the tip given
 - (1a) Plots that represent the given data
 - (1b) What percentage of people rounded off their bill to a whole number?
 - (1c) What percentage tips did people give on average?

#### 2. Sex variable and how it related to the total bill & tip given
 - (2a) Plots to show the relationship between sex and tip given
 - (2b) Is there a relation between the meal time and the sex paying? 

#### 3. Tip given in relation to the Day
 - (3a) Plot to show the relationship between the Tip given and day of the week
 - (3b) Breakdown of the total tips over the four days
 - (3c) Color plot of where the majority of tips came from on each day

#### 4. Total bill and Tip in relation to Size of the group
 - (4a) Average bill price per person
 - (4b) What Group Sizes gave the best tip

#### 5. Smoking and the time of the day
 - (5a) Dataframe of sex, time and smoker
 - (5b) Was there a larger amount of smokers at lunch or dinner?
